        <h3 id="australia">Snapper Rocks - Australia</h3>
        <p>Snapper Rocks is a small rocky outcrop on the northern side of Point Danger at the southern end of Rainbow Bay on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It is a famous surf break and today the start of the large sand bank known to surfers as the Superbank. Since 1995 the Tweed River sand bypass system has pumped sand from the Tweed River mouth to beaches to the north to ensure the river mouth is safe for shipping, and to stabilise coastal erosion north of the river.  </p>

        <p>Two things are certain at the Oi Rio Pro every year: the crowd is the biggest we see on Tour and Brazilian competitors have a strong showing here compared to other events. Other less-than-certain-but-still-very-possible scenarios include: Kelly Slater pulling out of the event to go surf Cloudbreak; the event getting moved to another beach because of water pollution; and ‘#worldshameleague’ starts trending on Instagram after a Brazilian is knocked out by an Australian surfer. Also, get used to the word ‘Deus’, you’ll be hearing it a lot.</p>

        <h3 id="usa">Hawaii - USA</h3>
        <p>Think of Hawaii and surfing is sure to be one of the first images that come to mind. This incredible sport has played an integral part in the development and identity of the islands, and its roots can be traced back to the 4th century A.D. when Polynesians began to make their way to the islands from Tahiti and the Marquesas. The rich tradition of surfing flourished and the best surf boards and beaches were reserved for royalty. Sadly, the arrival of Westerners to the islands contributed to the near demise of this rich tradition steeped in art, culture, and religion. A cash economy was created, people had less free time, and Protestant Missionaries discouraged the practice.</p>

        <h3 id="france">Seignosse - France</h3>
        <p>Hossegor surf might take the headlines, but the pros will often slink away to the Seignosse breaks when they’re working. Why? Well, this small beach town is home to some of the gnarliest, most fantastic beach breaks the world can offer. Move over Supertubos, the peaks here are wedgy, hollow, fast and consistent. They form on sandbanks that line the shore just out at sea. That means they are prone to some changes, particularly after storm season, although things stay pretty steady from season to season on at the main spots. In addition to that, Seignosse surf spreads northeast along Landes’ coast, meaning this one really gets the full whack from those winter NW swells.  </p>

        <h3 id="polynesia">Tahiti - French Polynesia</h3>
        <p>Tahiti is a gorgeous place to visit in the South Pacific.  With its black sand beaches, lagoons, waterfalls, two extinct volcanoes, the island of Tahiti is a popular vacation destination, particularly for honeymoons. Tahiti is the largest island in French Polynesia, which is a set of islands located in the South Pacific Ocean, approximately halfway between Australia and California.  Tahiti is home to the city of Papeete which is the capital of French Polynesia. French Polynesia is part of the French Overseas Collectivities (or Collectivité d’Outre Mer in French) which means it is one of the French overseas territories which have specific status and institutions.  </p>
